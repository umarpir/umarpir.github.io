## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/aboutme.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Umar and I am a Software engineer fairly early on In my career. I work full time and consider myself as of recently as a Full-Stack Engineer. Along with that I've been working on a few projects which I'll be posting in my blog along with just general things. Although I've graduated, I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ as not only am I eager to both constantly build on my academic foundations and stay in tune with the latest software, but I am also always looking for new things to learn and get into both professionally and as general fun!

### What I'm good at
<div class="box">
  <p>
  <ol>
  <li>  
Backend:
I love crafting backend solutions using different languages. Right now it's a mix of Node and Java, which I'm very comfortable with, but I have GO in my scope of learning so stay tuned for a few updates there.
</li>
  <li>  
Frontend:
Frontend is a new passion I have. Creating React apps for the past year has given me the skills to consider myself a Full-stack engineer and creating quick, responsive UIs is something I now look forward to.
</li>
  <li>  
Bridging the Database Divide:
Data is my playground, and I'm equally at home navigating the relational world of PostgreSQL and the document-oriented realm of MongoDB. Whether it's data modeling, efficient queries, or performance optimization, I'm your go-to bridge between data and code.
</li>
<li>  
Learning Apprentice:
I'm always eager to expand my tech vocabulary, constantly learning and exploring new frameworks and tools. While I'm early in my journey, my thirst for knowledge and ability to apply it quickly makes me a fast learner and adaptable team player.
