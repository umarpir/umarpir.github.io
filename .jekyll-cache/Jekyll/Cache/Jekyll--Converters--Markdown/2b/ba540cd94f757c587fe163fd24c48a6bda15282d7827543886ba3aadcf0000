<p>My name is Umar and I am currently studying Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at Brunel University. Along with that Iâ€™ve been working on a few projects which Iâ€™ll be posting in my blog along with just general things. Although Iâ€™m due to graduate next year, I consider myself a â€˜forever student,â€™ as not only am I eager to both constantly build on my academic foundations and stay in tune with the latest software, but I am also always looking for new things to learn and get into both professionally and as general fun!</p>
