<h4>Neural networks?</h4>
</header>
<p>A Neural network is a type of machine learning model that is loosely inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
It consists of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that can learn to identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns.</p>
<p>Neural networks can be thought of as a black box that takes in input data, processes it through a series of layers, and produces an output.
<p>Neural networks can be thought of as a black box that takes in input data, processes it through a series of layers, and produces an output. 
The input data can be anything really, from images to videos or even just simple numbers and the output can be a prediction about what the input represents.
There are also many types of neural networks that can be used depending on the task at hand : </p>
<h3>Types of Neural Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</li>
<li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</li>
<li>Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)</li>
</ul>

<p>Neural networks have been used for a variety of tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</p>

The number of layers in a neural network can vary depending on the complexity of the problem being solved, but there are typically three main types of layers: the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.
