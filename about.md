## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/aboutme.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Umar and I am currently studying Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at Brunel University. Along with that I've been working on a few projects which I'll be posting in my blog along with just general things. Although I’m due to graduate next year, I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ as not only am I eager to both constantly build on my academic foundations and stay in tune with the latest software, but I am also always looking for new things to learn and get into both professionally and as general fun!
