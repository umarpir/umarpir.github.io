  <h2>MERN</h2>
  <h3>And using JS ....?</h3>
  </header>
<p>Coming from a "purist" backend background, where all you talk about is OOP vs FP and constantly shitting on JS, for obvious reasons I never really had Javascript in my scope of learning. Yes I always knew I needed to know a bit of front-end for some Full stack projects but i never really thought much of it... Until i got put into a front-end team on my grad scheme. </p>
<p>I started learning some React and quickly realised that its not too bad(shout out Tony.) You start to realise that using these heavy languages isn't really needed for small e-commererce websites. Using Java for a small project is just beyond overkill so i looked for an alternative. I thought about learning Go, but would have go through the effort of learning a new language. Meanwhile i was learning about node.js express graphQL, mongo and found that this stack (MERN) was by far the most simple way of developing a quick and easy project. I could write all my code in JS so no context switching and development time is relatively quick. </p>
<h3>What is MERN</h3>
<h5>In a nutshell...</h5>

  <h2>A Big Example</h2>
  <h4>This pretty much sums up the everything</h4>
  </header>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/JavaString.png" alt="" /></span>The goal here is to print "hello world" backwards. Pretty easy right? So for all my Java people, you can see what's going on here. A simple class, with a method returning a string. we have a new String builder, and in the method, we have a for loop. The for loop will be the length of the String used, and it basically iterates backwards producing the String backwards. In the main method below we create a String variable and set it to "hello world" and using system.out.println we put that variable inside the method and the output will be hello world backwards. That's how you do it in Java!
  </p>

<p>And nowâ€¦ in Python</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PythonString.png" alt="" /></span>Thats it. And now you get why simplicity can win. The EXACT same output. After spending a lot of time using Python, not only just learning simple syntax like dictionaries and reversing Strings, but using it in my Machine learning projects, it seems to be like this for a lot of things which makes me think, why is Java just so difficult.
  </p>

<h4>How much easier is it?</h4>
<p> To sum things up, Python is a lot easier. After spending some time switching from Python to Java for different Projects, this kind of thing seems to be a reoccurring theme where it's just so much more long-winded to do simple things in Java. Yet for some reason, I find Java so much more structured and clean. Although Python is hands-down a lot easier, better for things like machine learning and just way easier to learn especially after having done Java,
   I'm kind of comfy with Java and plan to keep it as my go-to language for the time being.
